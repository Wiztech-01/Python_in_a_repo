#learning the pimitive data types 

"""
   The following are the primitive data types in Python
   
   1. Strings = "Festus"     in strings,  a valid sting can have either double or single quote. also ensure the consistency when using either of the quote
               
                 
   2. Integers = 45     majorly they are only whole numbers from 0 - 9
                 - In python, the integer can be positive or negative numbers
                  
   3. Floats = 3.14     All the decimal point number that you can think of 
               - In python, the decimal point is represented by a dot (.)
   4. Boolean = True/False  it can also be stated as a yes or no, 1/0 
               - Remember in python, the first letter of the boolean value must be in capital letter
